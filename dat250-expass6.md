# DAT250, Experiment Assignment 6

### implementation

I added Spring AMQP and a few localhost RabbitMQ settings, then turned on @EnableRabbit so @RabbitListener methods get picked up. Since votes can be anonymous, I also made Vote.voter optional.

On the messaging side I made a small AmqpConfig that provides a JSON converter, a RabbitTemplate, an AmqpAdmin, and one durable queue for the app. I also added a AmqpTopicsService. When a poll is created, the server declares that exchange and binds our queue to it with the routing key vote. I trigger this from PollManager.addPoll

Then I built the consumer: a small VoteEventListener with a single @RabbitListener method. It gets a VoteEvent, logs it, creates a Vote, and updates the in-memory store. To make sure other clients also see votes that come in through my REST API, I added a small producer VoteEventPublisher. In POST /votes I save the vote and then publish a matching VoteEvent to the poll with the routing key vote.

I wrote StandAloneVotePublisher, a tiny Java main that connects to RabbitMQ and sends a JSON vote to the poll with the same routing key. Running it while the app is up shows a log line from the listener, and the /results endpoint shows the counts going up.

### Technical problems
Getting RabbitMQ running locally was fine, but wiring it into Spring took some trial and error.
This includes the listener not starting because of missing annotations and wiring, a message conversion error where the listener method expected one type while Spring was converting the payload to another, and on the REST side, some fields didnâ€™t line up between the request and what the server actually saved, which led to incomplete events and which blew up my terminal and caused the spring boot app to crash. I also had to add a test profile so that my tests could run without rabbitmq dependencies.
